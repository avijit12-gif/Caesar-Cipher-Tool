# Caesar-Cipher-Tool
Just built a Caesar Cipher Tool in Python! This simple script allows users to encrypt and decrypt messages using the classic shift cipher technique. It also includes a simulated input system for testing automation.

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of string manipulation, ASCII operations, modular arithmetic, and input handling in Python. I also explored how to structure interactive console applications and handle user inputs efficiently.

Excited to keep learning and building more!
